SIMPLIFIED AMAZON DYNAMO

1) Implemented partitioning, replication and crash-recovery failure handling.
2) Consistent hashing for node and key distribution. ID space partitioning/re-partitioning based on hash values generated by SHA-1. Timestamp based object versioning for eventually-consistent data objects.
3) Replica synchronization mechanism after recovery from a failure.
